    Greetings!<br>
    My name is Kyle. I hold a degree in applied physics, have a career
    as an engineer, and like to code in my free time.
  </p>
  <p>
    While you may find me at a piano bench or playing video games with
    friends and family when I am not studying or working; my favorite
    pastime is enjoying life with my wife Alana and my son Arlen.

    Here are some places you can find out much more about me:
